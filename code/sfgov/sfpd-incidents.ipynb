    "A review of the [data dictionary for the police incidents](https://bit.ly/2x7Ta2P) reveals that this data can be tricky to work with. The documentation states that each incident can have multiple records, one for each type of infraction reported:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For example, an officer may have a warrant for an arrest\n",
    "and while making the arrest discovers narcotics in the individual’s possession. The officer would record an incident code for the warrant as well as the discovery of narcotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the data contains supplemental reports that correct or update initial reports. For these reasons, careful handling would be required to avoid over-counting incidents.\n",

    "Python has a number of charting libraries, each with a different set of strengths. One of the oldest and still most popular libraries is [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/index.html), which offers fine-grained control over charting elements. [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) are popular alternatives that simplify the work of creating visualizations, so you should definitely check these out as well.\n",
